# Demo application from DevIgnition

I used this as a demo during my DevIgnition [polyglot AS talk](http://torquebox.org/2011/12/05/devignition-preso/).
It is based on mgoldmann's [Confitura demo](https://github.com/goldmann/confitura-2011-torquebox-demo).

This demo is only runnable within an AS7 that includes the TorqueBox and Immutant modules,
which is currently not a straightforward process, so you'll only be able to read the code at this
point.
