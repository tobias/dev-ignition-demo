Provides a CDI bean that classifies tweets. 

You can build via `mvn package`, which will generate `target/cdi.jar`. 
You'll need to then copy this jar into `../tweetshow/lib/`. 

*Note:* you'll only need to build and copy the jar if you make changes 
to TweetClassifier.java - cdi.jar has already been placed into `../tweetshow/lib/`
for you.
